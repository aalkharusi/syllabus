## Policies

- I enforce all CS department course policies, including the attendance and plagarism policy (see the policy document in this repository).
- I do not tolerate scholarship fraud. If you are taking the class with no intention of completing it, I will drop you from the class.
- Much of the grading in this class is subjective.  By taking this class, you agree that you're okay with my best efforts.
- Reasonable accommodations are provided for students who are registered with Disability Services and make their requests sufficiently in advance. For more information, contact Disability Services (MBSC 111, Phone: 554-2872, TTY: 554-3799) or go to the website: www.unomaha.edu/student-life/inclusion/disability-services.
